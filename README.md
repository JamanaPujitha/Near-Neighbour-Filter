# 🧠 Near-Neighbour Filter (NNF) – Image Noise Reduction (MATLAB + Xilinx)

This project removes **salt & pepper noise** from images using the **Near-Neighbour Filter technique**, implemented in **MATLAB** and deployed on **Xilinx Vivado (FPGA)**.

### 🚀 What this project does
- Detects noisy pixels (0 / 255 intensity)
- Replaces only the noisy pixels using nearest valid neighbour
- Restores image without blur (better than median/average filter)

### 🧩 Why Near-Neighbour Filter?
Traditional filters blur edges.  
NNF preserves details by modifying **only noisy pixels**, not the whole image.

### 🔧 Technologies Used
- MATLAB (image processing)
- Xilinx Vivado simulation

### ✨ Result

- Noise removed efficiently
- Image clarity retained
- FPGA implementation proves real-time processing capability
